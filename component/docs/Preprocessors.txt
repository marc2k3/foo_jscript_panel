DESCRIPTION
All preprocessors are started with "==PREPROCESSOR==" and ended with "==/PREPROCESSOR==":

// ==PREPROCESSOR==
// ...
// ==/PREPROCESSOR==

And be aware that all preprocessors (directives) are case sensitive.

DIRECTIVES
Directives should be started with "@", and placed into a single comment.

// @directive "value-here"

IMPORT
@import "path"
Load external script from "path". These files should be UTF8 only. You can place
%fb2k_component_path% and %fb2k_profile_path% in to "path", they
will be expanded while parsing.

Support for %fb2k_path% was removed in v2.4.1.
